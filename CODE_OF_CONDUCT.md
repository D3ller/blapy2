# Blapy V2 Code of Conduct

Intersel and the Blapy V2 team are committed to preserving and fostering a
diverse, welcoming community. Below is our community code of conduct, which
applies to our repositories and organizations, issue trackers, discussions,
documentation, and any other Blapy V2-supported communication group, as
well as any private communication initiated in the context of these
spaces. This code of conduct must be followed by everyone contributing to
the Blapy V2 project, regardless of affiliation or position.

Simply put, community discussions should be

 * respectful and kind;
 * about Blapy V2 and web development;
 * about features, code, and ideas, not the individuals involved.

## Be respectful and constructive.

Treat everyone with respect. Build on each other's ideas. Each of us has the
right to enjoy our experience and participate without fear of harassment,
discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or subtle. Remember that
Blapy V2 is used by developers from around the world and that you may not be
communicating with someone in their primary language. We all get frustrated
when debugging complex web applications, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn
into personal attacks.

## Speak up if you see or hear something.

You are empowered to politely engage when you feel that you or others are
disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what
they are doing - politely bringing their behavior to their attention is
encouraged.

If you are uncomfortable speaking up, or feel that your concerns are not being
duly considered, you can email github@intersel.org to request involvement
from a community manager. All concerns shared with community managers will be
kept confidential, but you may also submit an issue on our GitHub repository
with the "community" label. Please note that without a way to contact you, an
anonymous report may be difficult to act on. In cases where a public response is
deemed necessary, the identities of victims and reporters will remain confidential
unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.

While all reports will be taken seriously, the Blapy V2 community managers may
not act on complaints that they feel are not violations of this code of
conduct.

## We will not tolerate harassment of any kind, including but not limited to:

 * Harassing comments
 * Intimidation
 * Encouraging a person to engage in self-harm
 * Sustained disruption or derailing of threads, issues, discussions, etc.
 * Offensive or violent comments, jokes or otherwise
 * Inappropriate sexual content
 * Unwelcome sexual or otherwise aggressive attention
 * Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
 * Distribution or threat of distribution of people's personally identifying
   information, AKA "doxing"
 * Code sabotage or malicious contributions

## Consequences for failing to comply with this policy

Consequences for failing to comply with this policy may include, at the sole
discretion of the Blapy V2 community managers:

 * a request for an apology;
 * a private or public warning or reprimand;
 * a temporary ban from the GitHub repository, discussions, or other
   Blapy V2-supported communication group, including loss of contributor status;
 * a permanent ban from any of the above, or from all current and future
   Blapy V2-supported or Intersel-supported communities, including loss of
   contributor status.

Participants warned to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately; failure to do so will result in an escalation of consequences.

Bans or other consequences under this policy can be appealed by email to
github@intersel.org.

## Our commitment to the open source community

Blapy V2 is built for developers, by developers. We believe in:

 * **Inclusivity**: Everyone should feel welcome to contribute, regardless of their experience level with JavaScript, web development, or open source.
 * **Learning**: We encourage questions, help newcomers, and share knowledge freely.
 * **Quality**: We strive for excellence in code, documentation, and community interactions.
 * **Innovation**: We welcome creative ideas and constructive feedback to make Blapy V2 better.
